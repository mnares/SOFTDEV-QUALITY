			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.joomlapolis.com/images/jpnewsletter/jpn201806/cb22conn_640.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/community-builder">Community Builder</a> can be freely <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/downloads/free" rel="alternate">downloaded</a> by all registered members</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>We just released <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/community-builder">Community Builder 2.2</a> with <strong>3 new features</strong> and <strong>3 bug fixes</strong>.</p>
<p>A huge <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to Kyle (aka krileon) who has been <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/blog/kyle/18775-bootstrap-4-and-fontawesome-5">working on this since January</a> and has done an <strong>awesome job</strong> making <strong>Community Builder one of the first Joomla extensions to get Bootstrap 4 support</strong>!</p>
<p>A detailed changelog is available in the discussion thread. The <strong>main new feature</strong> of CB 2.2 is a <strong>new, awesome, modern, clean looking user interface with improved mobile responsiveness</strong>, using the brand new <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> that has been selected for <strong>Joomla 4 (to be released later this year)</strong>.</p>
<p>All our Joomlapolis plugins have also been updated to support CB 2.2 and Bootstrap 4. Paid subscribers can download latest CB 2.2 compatible add-ons from the download area. Once you install or upgrade to CB 2.2, you will need to upgrade all your Joomlapolis add-ons for CB 2.2 clean display compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Community Builder 2.2 is a major release</strong> and all users should <strong>first test on a cloned environment</strong> for compatibility issues with their other add-ons and their Joomla template.</p>
<p>We will be updating our <a href="http://demo.cbdemosites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo website</a> to CB 2.2 asap, but in the meantime, we have provided above a screenshot of the completely <strong>redesigned Connections management</strong> page.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5730-joomla-3-8-8-release.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joomla 3.8.8 is here</a> - a security and bug fixes release!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Joomla project team has recently released version 3.8.8, a <strong>security and bug fixes release.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/community-builder">Community Builder</a> 2.1.4 (latest build) and all Joomlapolis <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons">add-ons</a> work just fine with Joomla 3.8.8. You can see everything in action on our <a href="http://demo.cbdemosites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo site</a>.</p>
<p>Joomla 3.8.8 addresses 9 low- and moderate-priority security vulnerabilities / hardenings and fixes over 50 minor bugs.</p>
<p>This is a highly recommended upgrade for all Joomla 3.x series sites. <strong>As always</strong>, before any Joomla upgrade on your live website, <strong>take a backup</strong> just in case anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>You can learn more about these security and bug fixes by <a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5730-joomla-3-8-8-release.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reading the Joomla 3.8.8 announcement</a> and, <strong>important</strong>, by visiting the <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Category:Version_3.8.8_FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joomla 3.8.8 release issues wiki</a> (to check for known release issues and important notes before you upgrade).</p>
<p>With new Joomla 3.8.8 installations, a few security- and privacy-related default settings have improved. You may wish to revisit these settings on your existing Joomla sites after upgrading to Joomla 3.8.8, since the Joomla 3.8.8 upgrade of existing sites will not change those settings for your existing site. Here again, visiting the Joomla 3.8.8 release wiki will lead you to the <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Joomla_3.8.8_notes_about_the_changed_default_settings" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joomla 3.8.8 notes about the changed default settings</a> page that details which default settings have changed and <strong>how to also change them on your existing sites</strong>.]]></description>

			<title>GDPR and what it means for your Community Builder site</title>
			<link>https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/18789-gdpr-and-what-it-means-for-your-community-builder-site</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.joomlapolis.com/news/18789-gdpr-and-what-it-means-for-your-community-builder-site</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.joomlapolis.com/images/jpnewsletter/jpn201805/gdpr_640.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;disclaimer&gt;</strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">This article does not provide legal advise - please consult a lawer.</span><strong>&lt;/disclaimer&gt;</strong></p>
<p>There are millions of articles currently on the Internet discussing the European Union <strong>G</strong>eneral <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>P</strong>rotection <strong>R</strong>egulation (GPRD) - last time I typed GPRD in Google I got <strong>19,500,000</strong> results. This regulation is planned to go into effect on <strong>May 25th, 2018</strong> (unless a delay is granted).</p>
<p>As a <strong>Joomla Community Builder</strong> website owner this new regulation most likely affects you - even if your website is not located in a European Union state. If your site has a registration form, you are collecting data from your website visitors and some of those visitors might live in a European Union state - tag your it!</p>
<p>The simplest way to go about GDPR compliance is to address the following <strong>7 aspects of the requlation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Consent</strong> • <strong>Breach Notification</strong> • <strong>Right to Data Access</strong> • <br /><strong>Right to be forgotten</strong> • <strong>Data Portability</strong> • <strong>Privacy by Design</strong><br /><strong>Potential Data Protection Officers</strong></p>
<p>You will most likely not need to be concerned with the Data Protection Officers aspect as this pertains to large corporations that handle lots of personal data (but once again remember the disclaimer). Kyle's <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/blog/kyle/18788-gdpr-compliance-with-community-builder">GDPR Compliance with Community Builder</a> blog is a great starting point for these 7 points and it also provides some useful reference links. We <strong>strongly suggest</strong> you read it now.</p>
<p>As you see from Kyle's blog, things are not that complicated as you should keep in mind that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Community Builder Terms and Conditions field</strong> helps you tackle the <strong>Consent</strong> aspect for your <strong>privacy policy</strong> along with the <strong>registration date / time stamp</strong> recorded during the CB registration process. You can also use the <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-profile-update-logger">CB Profile Update Logger</a> as proof of user consent.</li>
<li>The <strong>Right to be forgotten</strong> aspect can be requested by configuring a simple <strong>Joomla contact form</strong> (to allow your users to request to be deleted from your website) and you can manually delete the user from the <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/documentation/277-community-builder/reference-guide/18425-user-management">Community Builder User Management</a> page. Yup, there is no mandate to automate the deletion process, but you can if you want with the <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-privacy">CB Privacy</a> <strong>Delete Me field</strong> feature.</li>
<li>The <strong>Right to Access</strong> aspect can be satisfied with a simple <strong>CB profile</strong> view that allows the user to see all the data you have collected about them. As Kyle states, you can also enhance this by using a <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-code-field">CB Code Field</a> field or a <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-query-field">CB Query Field</a>.</li>
<li>If the data you have gathered has been compromized, the <strong>Breach Notification</strong> directive gives you 72 hours to notify the EU authorities. You can also use the CB <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/documentation/277-community-builder/reference-guide/18444-user-management-mass-mailer">User Management Mass Mailer</a> functionality to quickly notify your users of the breach.</li>
<li>The <strong>Privacy by Design</strong> aspect can be addressed using the powerful <strong>Joomla ACL</strong> functionality and if needed with the <a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/addons/cb-privacy">CB Privacy</a> powered user controlled privacy features.</li>
<li>The <strong>Data Portability</strong> aspect can be satisfied using <strong>phpmyadmin</strong> to export user specific data from your Joomla database. You can also use CB Juice to export CB related user data and a <strong>planned future release</strong> of CB Privacy will also export user data.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5731-joomla-3-9-and-joomla-3-10.html">Joomla 3.9 is also planning to be released with a new privacy component</a> that Joomlapolis will be tapping into with a future Joomla 3.9 compatible plugin.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important and probably most time-consuming part is to review your <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> and make it clear and easy to understand and GDPR-compliant, like Kyle explains in his blog.</p>
<p>Key take-aways from this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't panic</li>
<li><a href="https://www.joomlapolis.com/blog/kyle/18788-gdpr-compliance-with-community-builder">read Kyle's excellent blog</a></li>
<li>you don't have to automate everything day one</li>
<li>you already have the tools to be compliant</li>
<li>more tools will follow with Joomla 3.9</li>
</ul>
<p>We are here to help you!</p>]]></description>
